  CollectCoins PettingZoo environment.

  This a Chess like, two players turns board game.
  The aim of the game is to collect more coins than the opponent.
  On each turn a the player's piece makes a move.
  If a coin is present in the destination the count is increased for the player.
  The game ends when there are not more coins on the board to collect. We then compare which player got the most.

  Note: a 'rock' can make a 1 distance step only. In the future we'll have also the regular interpretation for rock.

  Note: pieces don't eat one another and cannot step on each other.
  Pieces can only move to a free square with a legal move, eather collecting a coin, or not collecting a conin if there is no coin in the destination.
